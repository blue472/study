    <p>Napoli paid tribute to their legendary former player Diego Maradona before their Europa League match against HNK Rijeka on Thursday.
    Argentina great Maradona, who won two Serie A titles with Napoli, died on Wednesday aged 60.
    The Stadio San Paolo was illuminated in Maradona's honour on Wednesday night as fans gathered to pay their respects.
    Napoli owner Aurelio de Laurentiis wrote in an open letter that he wants to rename the stadium after Maradona.
    The mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, also backed the idea.<br><br>

    In an letter paying tribute to Maradona, De Laurentiis wrote: "You leave us with a great testament of what it means to be a man of fragility, strength and absolute love for life and one's neighbour.
    "Your weaknesses, your imperfections, your mistakes are tantamount to your immense greatness."
    A minute's silence was held before Thursday's match against Croatian side Rijeka, during which all the Napoli players wore shirts with 'Maradona 10' on the back.
    Napoli won the match 2-0 and lead Group F by two points with two games to play.
    Maradona was at Napoli between 1984-91 and helped them win the league title in 1987 and 1990, and the Uefa Cup in 1989.
    "I believe it is right to name the San Paolo after you, so we can keep you with us as a witness of the excellent path this team has taken," De Laurentiis added.
    "Thank you, Diego. You are, and will always be, with all of us."</p>
